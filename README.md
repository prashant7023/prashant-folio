# Portfolio Website â€” v1

My name is Prashant Singh, a Developer & Web designer based in India. I enjoy crafting websites that aid business growth and software that makes lives easier; Honing technology, to better ease lives and improve the world I live in.

I created this website to showcase my capabilities on the frontend, and to deepen my understanding of framer motion. I learnt certain things building this site and by going through the code you stand a chance to learn new things too and better improve your frontend skills.
